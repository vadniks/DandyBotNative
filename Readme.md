# DandyBotNative
This is a QT port of the Peter Sovietov's DandyBot
(https://github.com/true-grue/DandyBot) which was written in 2021-2022
and which I was inspired of.

Ported from Python and Tkinter to the QT framework and C++ by Vad Nik
(https://github.com/vadniks/DandyBotNative) in 2023 for educational purpose.
